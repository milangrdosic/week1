Inchworm problem;

given length of branch, and distance between leaves and that the worm only eats on rest.
given example 1:: 12,6,4 returns 2

12 / 4 = 3 so 4 leaves on the branch. (0, 4, 8, 12)
12 / 6 = 2, so the worm stops tiwce. 

given there is a leaf at the beggining middle and end, (3 leaves),
the worm eats twice.

example 2,

21, 7, 3

21 / 7 = 3, stops 3 times,
21 / 3 = 7, 7 leaves,

stops are 0, 7, 14, 21
leaves are 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21

there for, i could initialize 2 arrays where the 1st index is 0 for both, and fill the array with rest and leaf points,


AFTER COMPLETION::

arrays are not dynamically casted so i kept track of the entries of leaves and rests in there respective array,
should of used dynamic arrays to avoid this.
The leaves eaten result was founding by comparing arrays and counting each succesful comparison (where element in one array is the same in another),
before reaching the end of the rests array.
