Problem Understanding and Initial Strategy:

Given the task of identifying "good" times based on the equality of the products of their digits, I recognized the need for an algorithm that can efficiently navigate through time increments. The problem requires splitting a time's digits in three potential configurations, checking each for product equality:

H and H
- The first digit and the product of the remaining three.
HH and MM - The product of the first two digits and the product of the last two.
HH
and M - The product of the first three digits and the last digit.
The strategy involved parsing the "HH
" format, iterating over the time range, and applying these checks systematically.

Development and Troubleshooting:

Initial challenges arose when handling times that span across midnight, such as from "23:00" to "01:00". 
 The basic loop structure failed to account for this, as it would prematurely terminate due to the start time being numerically greater than the end time.

Initially, the loop structure did not correctly handle cases where the afterTime was numerically
 less than the beforeTime, which is typical when the time range spans over midnight. 
 This was evident when the algorithm failed to count any "good" times in test cases like "23:00" to "01:00".

Introduced a conditional reset for the minute counter inside the nested loop. 
 This was crucial for starting the minute count from 0 on the next hour immediately
 after the first loop iteration, ensuring continuous counting through the day.

Adjusted the condition within the inner loop (if (i == finishHH && j > finishMM) break;) 
 to terminate the loop precisely when the end time is exceeded in the final hour of the range.


Insight and Reflection:

The problem-solving process revealed significant insights into handling date-time data types and their peculiarities, 
 such as day wrap-around and minute reset at each hour. The adjustment to a linear and continuous counting mechanism rather 
 than segmenting the day provided a more robust and error-resistant approach.
