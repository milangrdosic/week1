MagicSpell Problem::

the problem is to decode a spell by first finding the A's and Z's and reversing their position,
    e.g. "ABCZ" would be "ZBCA", only A's and Z's are reversed.

i want to create a seperate string for the A's and Z's then reverse them
and then add them back into their position,

so given a spell "AABZCADZA"
    the AZ string would be "AA_Z_A_ZA"
    and the spell string would be "__B_C_D__"
    then loop through checking both strings, if the first element of the string is '_'
    check add the element of the other string to the decode spell.

    e.g.
    if AZ string != '_' {
        decodedSpell = AZ substring of the index;
        create new string that then decrements the spell
        (so from "AZ_A_Z_AA" and "__B_C_D__" to "Z_A_Z_AA" and "_B_C_D__")
    }

I initally thought of this method as i was having trouble indexing the spell string
    and comparing elements, and my solution became greatly over complicated.

Upon reflection on a new day, the answer became far simpler.

I created a vecotr<char> array for holding the values and postions of A's and Z's in the
    spell array. I chose a vector array as it handles dynamic sizing and is safe of memory,
    and are quite easy to use.

The array is then reversed.

The spell is then looped through where any instance of A or Z is changes to the next element of
    the AZ array.

MonsterValley2 problem::

Manao needs to traverse a valley filled with monsters.

    The i-th monster he meets will have a scariness equal to dread[i]

Manoa will bribe some of the monsters he meets and make them join him.

    To bribe the i-th monster, Monao needs price[i] gold coins.
    The price will be either 1 or 2.

Manao travels alone at the start. Each monster he meets he has an option to bribe it, the monster  
    may decide to attack after.
        A monster will attack Manao if and only if he did not bribe it, and its scariness is strictly greater 
        than the total scariness of all monsters in Manao's party.
    
Put simply, if he comes across a monster that would attack him (scariess exceeds party's scariness
    he has to bribe them.

Or, if he encounters a monster that would not attack him, he may either bribe or simply walk past.

My initial Idea is to create a map to hold Manao's current monster and its cost.

itereate through the monsters, which is itterate through the array of dread and cost, comparing dread to manoas party's 
    scariness value, and bribing or skipping the monster.

if the monster is bribed, add to Manao's party and at the end add up the cost of his part and return the value.

My initial idea was very close and here is the solution I ended up with in greater detial.

Monao map is initialized with {dread[0]: price[0]} because Manao must bribe the first monster (he starts alone).

For each subsequent monster, newMonster map is created empty at the start of the loop.

For each newMonster, add the current monster's scariness and price to each state (s) from Monao
    and store it in newMonster. This is checking the outcome of bribing the monster.

If the current total scariness 's' is already greater than the monster's dread[i], 
    copy the state as is to newMonster (no additional cost) because Manao can safely pass without bribing.

After processing each monster, Monao is updated with the states from newMonster to use in the next iteration.

After all monsters are processed, the answer is the smallest value in Monao, 
    which represents the minimum cost required for Manao to safely traverse the entire valley.

RugSizes Problem::

The task is to identify all viable rug dimensions (width and length) that can completely 
    cover a given area. The critical condition is that no rug should have distinct even 
    dimensions for both width and length. For instance, a 4x4 rug is permissible, 
    but a 2x4 rug is not.

Acceptable rug dimensions are any integer widths and lengths, excluding pairs where both 
    are even and distinct from one another.

The solution must treat rug dimension pairs as undirected, meaning 6x9 and 9x6 are considered identical.

Start by iterating over possible widths from 1 up to and including the square root of the area. 
    This range is chosen because for any pair of factors of the area, at least one factor must be 
    less than or equal to its square root.

For each potential width 'w', calculate the corresponding length 'l' by dividing the area by 'w'
    This is efficient as it avoids unnecessary calculations by only considering divisors.

To validate dimenstions:
    Ensure w x l = area.
    Exclude configurations where both 'w' and 'l' are even and distinct.
    For symmetric cases like w = l, special consideration is given since such dimensions automatically satisfy the requirement.

Maintain a counter that only increments for valid and unique configurations. 
    By checking wâ‰¤l, we automatically account for the directionality of the dimensions,
    ensuring pairs like 6x9 and 9x6 are not double-counted.
