StreetParking::
goal is to park the car,
the park must not be --
- infront of private driveway
- infront of bus stop
- infornt of side street 
- 5 meters before bus stop
- 10 meters before a bustop
- 5 meters before side street
- 5 meters after side steet 

the street is represented as a string, with each index beign 5 meteres,
'D' is for driveway
'S' is for side street
'B' is for bus stop
'-' is for all other sections of street

Logic::

if current position is '-'
check other parking parameters,
- 5 meters before bus stop
- 10 meters before a bustop
- 5 meters before side street
- 5 meters after side steet 

if current position is 'D,B,S', return, itterate.
