Multiples Problem::

given 3 integer inputs being min, max and factor. Determine how many numbers within 
    that range are evenly divisible by factor.

simple for loop from min to max inclusively with an if statement checking the remainder of 
    the i-th value with the factor, and itterating a counter if the remainder is 0.

Barbecue Problem:://///
/////////////////////

///////////////////////////
///Design and thinking:://///
///////////////////////////
Determine which family member at a barbecue should lose their share of the meat based on a 
    series of votes. The complexity arises when members can vote multiple times for 
    different members, necessitating a robust system to handle potential ties in votes.

To manage the voting data I'm going to use two maps:

votesReceived: This map associates each memberâ€™s index with the number of votes they received.
votesCast: This map tracks the number of votes each member cast.
Solution Design: The process involves iterating through these voting records and applying a series of checks to decide who should be excluded based on:

The number of votes received.
The number of votes each member cast, in the event of a tie.
The smallest index as the final tiebreaker if ties persist after considering the above criteria.


///////////////////////
///Troubleshooting:://///
///////////////////////
The main difficulty arose in implementing the tie-breaking mechanism correctly. 
    Ensuring that the system was fair and adhered to the stipulated rules required careful 
    consideration and testing.

Condition Testing: I systematically tested the conditions for updating the candidate to be excluded. 
    This involved creating test scenarios where different members had the same number of votes but differed 
    in how many votes they cast.

Logical Verification: Each part of the if condition was verified for logical accuracy and completeness.
    I particularly focused on ensuring that the final tie-breaker (member index) was correctly implemented.

Adjustments were made to the initial implementation to better handle scenarios where multiple members had the 
    same vote count. By refining how votes cast were evaluated in the context of a tie, 
    I ensured that the system could handle all specified edge cases effectively.

Engaging with this problem has sharpened my analytical thinking and deepened my understanding 
    of using maps in C++. It has also reinforced the value of thorough testing in developing reliable software solutions.

RunLengthEncoding Problem::///
//////////////////////////////

The input strings are guaranteed to contain 0 to 50 characters, inclusive of numbers ('0'-'9') and uppercase letters ('A'-'Z'). 
The task is to decode such strings into their literal forms, handling constraints such as maximum length and ensuring that the 
    output doesn't exceed 50 characters.

I designed a loop that would traverse the input string character by character.
A number accumulator was used to build numbers as they appear before letters.
Upon encountering a letter, the accumulated number (if any) was associated with that letter to expand it appropriately.
Special consideration was given to cases where no number appears before a letter, defaulting the count to 1 for such scenarios.

Testing revealed issues with sequences where letters appeared without preceding numbers. I adjusted the logic to automatically treat these as having a multiplicity of 1.
Added a cumulative counter to ensure the total output length does not exceed the 50-character limit, returning "TOO LONG" if exceeded

This problem reinforced my understanding of string manipulation in C++, particularly how to dynamically parse and construct strings based on 
    conditional logic.

RGBStreet Problem::///
//////////////////////

I chose to implement a recursive function with memoization. This method allows a clear, logical breakdown of the decision process. 
    Each function call determines the minimal cost for the remainder of the houses based on the color chosen for the current house. 
    By storing already computed results in a memoization table, I aimed to prevent redundant calculations and optimize performance.

Initially, managing the transition between colors for adjacent houses was tricky. Ensuring that no two consecutive houses had the same color 
    and minimizing costs simultaneously required precise control over the recursive transitions.

This problem reinforced my understanding of dynamic programming and recursion. It highlighted the importance of memoization in optimizing recursive solutions, 
    especially in problems with overlapping subproblems.
