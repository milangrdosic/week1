Arrows problem::

The task is to find the length of the longest arrow in a given string. 
    An arrow consists of a sequence of '-' or '=' characters following either '<' (left arrow) or '>' (right arrow).

I decided to handle left and right arrows separately, 
    checking for the longest sequence of '-' or '=' after '<' and before '>'. 
    Initially, I attempted to solve the problem using while loops, 
    but I faced challenges in managing the loops correctly,
    especially in separating the identification of the arrowheads ('<' and '>') from measuring the length of the arrow body.

My final solution maintains separate logic for left and right arrows. 
    I used a primary for loop to iterate through the entire string, 
    allowing me to identify the arrowheads without repeating old positions. 
    Nested within this loop, I used additional for loops to measure the length of the arrow body.
    I did this by counting the '-' or '=' characters following each arrowhead. 
    After measuring each arrow, I checked if its length was the longest found so far, updating the maximum length accordingly. 
    This systematic approach allowed me to efficiently identify and count both left and right arrows.

The main issue I had in the beginning was properly identifying '<' and '>' within the string and then iterating through the rest of the string afterward. 
    The while loops I initially used made it challenging to manage the iteration process effectively, leading to incorrect identification and counting of arrows.


This problem taught me the importance of carefully managing loop logic, 
    especially when dealing with different types of patterns within the same problem. 
    It also reinforced the need to consider all possible variations of a pattern when designing a solution.
    I realized that I needed an overarching loop to iterate through the string, 
    combined with individual for loops to separate the identification and counting logic. 
    By switching to a primary for loop to handle the string iteration and using nested for loops to manage the arrow logic, 
    I was able to correctly identify and count the arrows without repeating old positions.

This problem taught me the importance of carefully managing loop logic, 
    especially when dealing with different types of patterns within the same problem. 
    It reinforced the need to consider all possible variations of a pattern when designing a solution and the significance of clear and consistent loop management.

When dealing with pattern recognition in strings, 
    it is crucial to handle each pattern variation systematically to avoid errors and ensure accurate results. 
    This problem highlighted the importance of thoughtful loop management in achieving correct and efficient results.

FracCount problem::

The task is to determine the position of a fraction (numerator/denominator) among all irreducible fractions between 0 and 1, 
arranged in increasing order of their values.

 My initial idea was to loop through all possible fractions with increasing denominators, 
    and for each fraction, check if it is irreducible 
    (i.e., the numerator and denominator are coprime). 
    I implemented this using nested loops: the outer loop iterated through possible denominators, 
    while the inner loop iterated through possible numerators for each denominator.

After implementing the initial design, 
    I realized that the approach could be optimized by stopping the iteration as soon as the target fraction was found. 
    I added an early return condition to the code, which improved the efficiency by avoiding unnecessary calculations once the desired fraction was located.

I encountered an issue when trying to create an if statement to check if the current fraction is irreducible. 
    My initial logic caused the program to skip over some fractions, leading to incorrect counting.

I used resources like GeeksforGeeks and discovered the gcd function available in the numeric library (C++17 or later). 
    By incorporating the gcd function into my if condition, 
    I was able to accurately determine whether a fraction was irreducible, 
    fixing the counting errors and ensuring the program worked correctly.

This problem reinforced the importance of understanding number theory concepts like the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) when working with fractions. 
    It also highlighted the need for optimizing algorithms for efficiency, 
    particularly when dealing with nested loops.

Recognizing early stopping conditions and leveraging existing libraries for mathematical operations can significantly enhance the efficiency and correctness of an algorithm. 
    This problem taught me to be mindful of these aspects during the design and implementation phases.

QuickSums Problem:: 

The first strategy involved a straightforward iterative approach where the string of digits was split into two substrings at every possible position. 
    The first substring (plusStr) was treated as a sequence of digits where each was added individually,
    while the second substring (remStr) was directly converted to an integer and added to the sum of plusStr.

Using a for loop, the string numbers was divided at each index from 1 up to the string's length. 
    For the left substring, digits were summed as individual components, incrementing an addition count for each non-'0' digit after the first. 
    The right substring was then added as a whole number to this sum. This approach aimed to check at each split if the total equaled the target sum, 
    returning the number of additions required.

This method had limitations, notably its inability to handle cases where multiple splits were necessary within plusStr itself to meet the target sum. 
    It also proved inefficient for larger strings or higher sums due to its linear scanning and repeated calculations.

This approach required multiple optimal splits to achieve the target sum. 
    The method struggled with performance and accuracy, as it did not account for the possibility of needing more than one split within the plusStr to correctly form the target.

It became clear that a more dynamic approach was necessary to effectively handle the complexity of multiple splits and their combinations.

I transitioned to a recursive method to explore every possible way of inserting plus signs into the string. 
    This allowed for a deeper and more flexible examination of split combinations.

To enhance the efficiency of the recursive solution, I implemented memoization to store the results of previously computed splits. 
    This significantly reduced the number of recalculations by caching intermediate sums and their respective minimum additions, 
    speeding up the process for larger input sizes.

The progression from an iterative to a recursive approach underscored the importance of selecting the right algorithmic strategy based on the problem's demands. 
    The experience reinforced my understanding of recursion and dynamic programming, particularly in problems involving numerous possible combinations and states.
The application of memoization taught me valuable lessons about optimizing recursive algorithms and managing computational overhead effectively.
