ThrowTheBall::

if the player with the ball has recieved the ball M times, the game is over.
else
if player has recieved ball 'p' times,
    and 'p' is even, 
        the ball is passed L places left.
    
    and if 'p' is odd,
        the ball is passed L places right.

Given N,M and L i will need to find the number of times the ball is passed.

N - is the number of friends (no less than 3 and no greater than 50).
M - is the numberof times a player can recieve the ball before the game is over (between 1-50)
L - is the number of spaces the ball is passed (between 1-50).

initialize N array for friends playing player 1 is index 0.

player 1 starts with the ball so index is 1, since 1 is odd the ball moves anti clockwise around the cirlce
in the instance of an array it moves end of the array and counts towards the start.

After Completion::

in the end created an array of N-1 and initialized array to 0

used a neverending while loop to handle main game logic
created a loop for the array for when the player pass left or right so the index is able to loop to the appropriate player
